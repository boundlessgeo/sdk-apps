Two basemaps are provided, ESRI world imagery and OSM streets. The header contains a navigation button and a DrawBox component. The tutorial walks the user through creating the Drawbox component, and modifying the user-created component to show output both in a summary box component at the bottom of the map panel, as well as in a info popup on the map panel.
